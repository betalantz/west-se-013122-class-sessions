# Building a React App with Modern Redux (RTK)

Redux Toolkit (RTK) was released in late-2019 as a package to streamline some of the set-up process for Redux by abstracting much of the configuration. It further allows developers to simplify their code by providing tools for common use cases, such as consolidating reducer and action creation into single files.
